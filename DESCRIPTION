Description: Provides three basic functions that support an implementation of Case 2 (profile case) best-worst scaling. The first is to convert an orthogonal main-effect design into questions, the second is to create a dataset suitable for analysis, and the third is to calculate count-based scores. For details, see Aizaki and Fogarty (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.jocm.2019.100171>.
